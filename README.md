# Amazon-Prime-Analysis
This project, part of a Revou academy mini course, analyzed the Amazon Prime Video Titles dataset—a streaming service offering a variety of movies, TV shows, original series, and documentaries—focusing on data cleansing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python, with key aspects such as the distribution of show types (Movies vs. TV Shows), ratings, release years, and top directors, leveraging libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to generate meaningful insights and visualizations for a comprehensive study of the platform's content.
